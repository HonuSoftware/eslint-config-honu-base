Contributions are welcome so long as they are thought out and willing be discussed before merging.

## Pull Requests
Should contain the following:
- Change to the ruleset
- Change to test case (or add one if lacking)
  - At some point I will add actual decent tests, but until then try to still with simple cases showing expected failure and expected pass

## Changing Current Styles
1. Present a development reason to change preferably with backing research, discussion elsewhere or a good argument.
1. Create a pull request

## New Rules
1. If there is simply a new ESLint rule that I don't have feel free to add it. With `0` strictness unless you have a good reason.
